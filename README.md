injection_payloads:
  - "' OR '1'='1"
  - "'; DROP TABLE users;--"
  - "1' OR '1'='1"
  - "admin'--"
```

## üìã Configuration Reference

    method: "GET"                           # Required: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
    body: '{"param": "value"}'             # Optional: Request body for POST/PUT requests
```

### Authentication Configuration

```

### Injection Payloads Configuration

```yaml
injection_payloads:
  - "' OR '1'='1"                    # Classic SQL injection
  - "'; DROP TABLE users;--"         # SQL DROP statement
  - "1' OR '1'='1"                   # Numeric SQL injection
  - "admin'--"                       # Comment-based SQL injection
  - "<script>alert('XSS')</script>" # XSS payload (if testing web APIs)

## üß™ Testing Methodology

### Authentication Testing

The scanner tests authentication by:

1. Sending requests with configured credentials
2. Analyzing HTTP response codes (200, 401, 403)
3. Verifying proper access control mechanisms
4. Testing for authentication bypass vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection Testing

The scanner tests for SQL injection by:

1. Sending baseline requests to establish normal response patterns
2. Testing with various SQL injection payloads
3. Analyzing response differences and error messages
4. Looking for indicators of successful injection

### HTTP Method Testing

The scanner validates HTTP method handling by:

1. Testing supported HTTP methods for each endpoint
2. Verifying proper handling of disallowed methods
3. Checking for method-based access control issues
4. Ensuring REST compliance

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Rate Limiting

To prevent overwhelming target APIs, configure rate limiting:

```yaml
rate_limiting:
  requests_per_second: 10
  max_concurrent_requests: 5
```

### Custom Headers

Add custom headers for requests:

```yaml
headers:
  "User-Agent": "API-Security-Scanner/1.0"
  "X-API-Key": "your-api-key"
  "Accept": "application/json"
```

### Proxy Configuration

Configure proxy settings for corporate environments:

```yaml
proxy:
  url: "http://proxy.company.com:8080"
  username: "proxy-user"
  password: "proxy-password"
```

## üö® Best Practices

### For Security Teams

1. **Run in Staging First**: Always test against staging environments before production
2. **Schedule Scans**: Run during off-peak hours to minimize impact
3. **Monitor Resources**: Watch for high CPU/memory usage during large scans
4. **Review Results**: Analyze findings and prioritize critical vulnerabilities

### For Development Teams

1. **Integrate into CI/CD**: Add security scans to your deployment pipeline
2. **Fix Findings Promptly**: Address security issues before deployment
3. **Update Configuration**: Regularly update API endpoints and test payloads
4. **Document Exceptions**: Maintain documentation for accepted risks

### For API Owners

1. **Understand Scope**: Clearly define which APIs can be tested
2. **Coordinate Testing**: Schedule scans with API maintenance windows
3. **Review Results**: Work with security teams to understand findings
4. **Implement Fixes**: Prioritize and deploy security patches

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Timeouts

```bash
# Increase timeout
./api-security-scanner -timeout 30
```

#### Authentication Failures

```yaml
# Verify credentials in config.yaml
auth:
  username: "correct-username"
  password: "correct-password"
```

#### SSL Certificate Issues

```bash
# Disable SSL verification (not recommended for production)
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/cert.pem
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
./api-security-scanner -verbose
```
