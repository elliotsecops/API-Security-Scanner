## üß™ Testing Methodology

### Authentication Testing

The scanner tests authentication by:

1. Sending requests with configured credentials
2. Analyzing HTTP response codes (200, 401, 403)
3. Verifying proper access control mechanisms
4. Testing for authentication bypass vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection Testing

The scanner tests for SQL injection by:

1. Sending baseline requests to establish normal response patterns
2. Testing with various SQL injection payloads
3. Analyzing response differences and error messages
4. Looking for indicators of successful injection

### HTTP Method Testing

The scanner validates HTTP method handling by:

1. Testing supported HTTP methods for each endpoint
2. Verifying proper handling of disallowed methods
3. Checking for method-based access control issues
4. Ensuring REST compliance

### XSS Vulnerability Testing

The scanner tests for XSS vulnerabilities by:

1. Sending baseline requests to establish normal response patterns
2. Testing with various XSS payloads
3. Analyzing response content for unsanitized payload reflection
4. Looking for indicators of successful XSS execution

### Header Security Analysis

The scanner analyzes HTTP response headers by:

1. Checking for presence of recommended security headers
2. Identifying insecure information disclosure headers
3. Validating cookie security attributes
4. Analyzing CORS policy configurations

### Authentication Bypass Testing

The scanner tests for authentication bypass by:

1. Sending requests without authentication credentials
2. Testing with invalid credentials
3. Checking for common bypass headers
4. Analyzing response codes for unauthorized access

### Parameter Tampering Detection

The scanner tests for parameter tampering by:

1. Modifying parameter values in requests
2. Adding extra parameters to requests
3. Testing for IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
4. Analyzing response behavior for parameter changes

### NoSQL Injection Testing

The scanner tests for NoSQL injection by:

1. Sending baseline requests to establish normal response patterns
2. Testing with various NoSQL injection payloads for MongoDB, CouchDB, and other document databases
3. Analyzing response differences and error messages for NoSQL syntax
4. Looking for indicators of successful NoSQL injection including:
   - Response time anomalies
   - Error messages containing NoSQL syntax
   - Response body changes indicating unauthorized data access
   - Status code deviations from baseline responses

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Rate Limiting

To prevent overwhelming target APIs, configure rate limiting:

```yaml
rate_limiting:
  requests_per_second: 10
  max_concurrent_requests: 5
```

### Custom Headers

Add custom headers for requests:

```yaml
headers:
  "User-Agent": "API-Security-Scanner/1.0"
  "X-API-Key": "your-api-key"
  "Accept": "application/json"
```

### Proxy Configuration

Configure proxy settings for corporate environments:

```yaml
proxy:
  url: "http://proxy.company.com:8080"
  username: "proxy-user"
  password: "proxy-password"
```

## üö® Best Practices

### For Security Teams

1. **Run in Staging First**: Always test against staging environments before production
2. **Schedule Scans**: Run during off-peak hours to minimize impact
3. **Monitor Resources**: Watch for high CPU/memory usage during large scans
4. **Review Results**: Analyze findings and prioritize critical vulnerabilities

### For Development Teams

1. **Integrate into CI/CD**: Add security scans to your deployment pipeline
2. **Fix Findings Promptly**: Address security issues before deployment
3. **Update Configuration**: Regularly update API endpoints and test payloads
4. **Document Exceptions**: Maintain documentation for accepted risks

### For API Owners

1. **Understand Scope**: Clearly define which APIs can be tested
2. **Coordinate Testing**: Schedule scans with API maintenance windows
3. **Review Results**: Work with security teams to understand findings
4. **Implement Fixes**: Prioritize and deploy security patches

## üìä Historical Reporting and Analysis

  trend_analysis: true
  storage_path: "./history"
  retention_days: 30
```

**Features:**
